# BrnoCache

Vizualization of geocache caches in Brno region.

### Geocaching

Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game using GPS-enabled devices. Participants navigate to a specific set of GPS coordinates and then attempt to find the geocache (container) hidden at that location.

## Inspiration

## Data

### Description

### Source

https://github.com/tomasbedrich/pycaching

### Preprocessing

calculate display coordinates

None: Only caches which are currently active are enclosed in the data. Canceled caches are not in the data.

## Used libraries

### Vega

https://vega.github.io/vega/

Visualization grammar, a declarative language for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. With Vega, you can describe the visual appearance and interactive behavior of a visualization in a JSON format, and generate web-based views using Canvas or SVG.

## Problems

- I had to repair bug in library pycaching used for collection of data. One type of logs was missing. [submitted merge request]

## Critical assessment and future work
